/*
This is the same graph class we made together in class, but we
are going to stick to grid-shaped graphs instead of arbitrary graphs for
your final. This is for 1 reason only - they will look much nicer in the console :)
All the topics we discussed and the algorithms you will be writing would work
on any shaped graph, grid or otherwise.

Grids are common types of graphs anyway - in well structured city blocks, in
raster images (like photoshop-filter algorithms), in video games, etc.

I've added several functions to make it more visually appealing, and to
make it work smoothly with user-input provided in main.cpp.

The only function we did together that I changed is the Display function,
which will display the graph as a grid of single chars instead of a long list
of city names and what they're connected to. Enjoy!
